# GeoAssist---An-open-source-autonomous-research-agent-for-geoscience-data-and-literature.-
LLM driven natural language to generate summaries, bibliography lists, download PDF reports autonomously, create Knowledge Graphs (GeoKG) and extract and visualise domain data (curently uses GPlates and Macrostrat).
You will need to login and create a free Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/) token to use the inference model os.environ.setdefault("HF_TOKEN", "API_KEY_HERE). Alternatively, you can download a local LLM using Ollama and easily modify the GEOAssist code to use that.
Ensure you set the download directory for PDF files. It is curently set to my download folder 'C:\Users\paulh\Downloads\Geological_AI_download' so you will need to change this to a folder on your machine.
If you see PDFs called 'untitled' in your downloads folder (not with date, author and title) it probably means it is a PDF scan (no text layer). Currently GEOAssist does not OCR PDF images (it will soon!). Also note if all PDFs are like this, no Knowledge Graph (Geo-KG) will be generated as it won't be able to read any text.
